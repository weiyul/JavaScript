<!-- This application allows you to calculate loan payment each month. The original code is from the book "JavaScript The Definitive Guide" By David Flangan
 * I retyped the code and made a slight modification by simply omitting the section of ZipCode and Sponsors, which I found cannot work without another php * file
 * If you want to see the origianl code, please go to http://examples.oreilly.com/9780596805531/

These elements have ids like "interest" and "years". These ids are used in the JavaScript code that follows the table. Note that some of the input elements define "onchange" or "onclice" event handlers. These specify strings of JavaScript code to be executed when the user enters data or clicks.-->
